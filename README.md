# CsharpProjects
In this Project I have tried to do CRUD operations in windows form(data grid view) by Serialization and Deserialization using IXmlSerializable API.
The first time when the form is loaded, all the previous data which was saved will be displayed by deserialization.
Any additional changes to this data like creation, updation or deletion will be allowed and there by giving an option to save the data.
To create a new data I have used a button to add row in data grid view and similarly for update and delete.
I have also included 2 extra buttons for refresh and clear-all, to make my work more easy.
